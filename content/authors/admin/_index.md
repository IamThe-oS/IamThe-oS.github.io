      I learned the basic and advanced queries of the Structured Query Language (SQL), which is often used to query databases that contain large data. One big advantage of databases compared to the other data storage, spreadsheet, is that databases are scalable and can save space by normalizing the data. Using SQL, we can model our data and normalize database with the star schema or the snowflake schema. SQL can also be used to perform data cleaning and data analysis of large amount of data.
